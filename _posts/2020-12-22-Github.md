# Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line
1.Create a new repository on GitHub.
2.Open Git Bash. Change the current working directory to your local project.
3.Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
> $ git init -b main

4.Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
>$ git add .
>\Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
>
5.Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
>$ git commit -m "First commit"
>\# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.

6.At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, copy the remote repository URL.

>$ git remote add origin *remote repository URL*
>\# Sets the new remote
>$ git remote -v
>\# Verifies the new remote URL

# Undo Last Git Commit with reset
[details](https://devconnected.com/how-to-undo-last-git-commit/)
> git reset --soft HEAD~1
If you are not familiar with this notation, “HEAD~1” means that you want to reset the HEAD (the last commit) to one commit before in the log history.
> git log --oneline
> // Results
> 3fad532  Last commit   (HEAD)
> 3bnaj03  Commit before HEAD   (HEAD~1)
> vcn3ed5  Two commits before HEAD   (HEAD~2)
The `git reset` command can be seen as the opposite of the `git add` command, essentially adding files to the Git index.
When specifying the `–soft` option, Git is instructed not to modify the files in the working directory or in the index at all.
In order to undo the last commit and discard all changes in the working
directory and index, execute the `git reset` command with the `–hard` option and specify the commit before HEAD (`HEAD~1`).
> git reset --hard HEAD~1
