# User mode vs Kernel mode
[User mode and Kernel mode Switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-mode-and-kernel-mode-switching/)
The User mode is normal mode where the process has limited access.
While the Kernel mode is the privileged mode where the process has unrestricted access to system resources like hardware, memory, etc.
Anything related to Process management, IO hardware management, and Memory management requires process to execute in Kernel mode.
